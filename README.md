Cerebra is the most powerful mutant detecting system currently available (for [Cerebral](http://cerebraljs.com)).

## Why the Cerebra name?

Cerebral is all about side effect management. A common side effect in JavaScript is mutation. This debugger helps you track these side effects and mutations. Another great tool for tracking mutations is [Charles Xaviers Cerebra located in the heart of Xavier's School For Higher Learning](<http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Cerebra_(Mutant_Detector)>). Now you can have your own Cerebra to help those mutants find their way in life.
